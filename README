This is a FreeBSD kernel module to present winbond W837* series and similar hardware monitoring chip info
as sysctl OIDs. Large portions were taken from mbmon, which is (C)1999-2004  Yoshifumi R. Shimizu.

Type "make" to build the kernel module.

The included patch is for conky-1.4.1. To use it, the ${winb} directive
is used in .conkyrc. It takes one argument, the name of the sensor.
These include:

fan[123], temp[123], vc[01], v33, v50[pn], v12[pn]

Have fun.
